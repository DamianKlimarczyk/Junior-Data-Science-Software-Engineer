# Titanic - data science project 

## INTRODUCTION
Tasks

### TASK1 - organizational instructions
 Create your own repository on Github or other public code versioning server. Use content of this project to create initial commit.
 
 Follow the rules:
* The solutions to all subsequnt tasks should be in your repository.
* Each task should be solved in separate branch using any number of commits. You can edit the code or add additional file explaining your way of thinking. The branch name should be related to the task, so we can know which branch applies to which task.
* All branches should finally be merged to master branch.
* At the end remember to share your repository with us.

### TASK2 - sense of humour
File with my favourite joke added to the docs directory.

### TASK3 - good practices
* Correct the code so it is easy to read, run and reuse.
* Remember about
  * README.md files
  * Code comments
  * quality and performance of code -- remove or fix badly written code

### TASK4 - feature engineering
I proposed better solution for feature engineering than the one given by you. You can find it in notebook directory.

### TASK5 - models
I chose ....... rather than ..........

### TASK6 - measures
Justification (and comparison with your model) of why I have chosen this particular model you will find in a notebook folder.

### TASK7 - docker
In docs you will find the Dockerfile that will allow you to run my code in the container.

### TASK8 - tests
Unit test were written wherever it was nessesary for function to be checked. You can find them in src folder.

### TASK9 - prediction api
In ..... folder you will find a code that is sharing my model via API. It is accessible by the HTTP protocol and is accepts and returns data in JSON format.

## Thanks for the opportunity!
